## 📊 Methodology

The project follows a structured approach:

1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset through descriptive statistics and visualizations.
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying relationships between features and the target variable (house prices).
3. **Regression Modeling**: Applying linear regression techniques to model the relationship between features and prices.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
